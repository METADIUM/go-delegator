# Metadium Proxy on AWS Lambda
Main functions are MetaID registration/update/recover and relaying JSON-RPC result with metadium node.

In addition, this project try porting web3 to Golang.

Furthermore it applied IPFS here to overwhelm limited stroage of blockchain.

# Prerequisite
1. Docker
    - Install docker (https://docs.docker.com/install/)
2. xgo
    - because of C compile in go-ethereum, we need improved cross-compiler
    ```shell
    docker pull karalabe/xgo-latest
    go get github.com/karalabe/xgo
    ```

# Build
```shell
cd $GOPATH/src/{repo start with bitbucket.org}
make
```

# Test
1. Move each module directory such as json, rpc and so on
2. Run testunit
    ```shell
    go test -v
    ```

# Deploy
1. Set Lambda on AWS
    - Function package: compressed binary file in $GOPATH/src/{repo}/bin
    - Handler: proxy (binary file name, it is optional)
    - Runtime: Go 1.x
    - (Optional) Include DynamoDB execution role to Lambda execution role
2. Set API Gateway as proxy on AWS
3. Add API Gateway as Lambda trigger
4. Add CloudWatch Logs

# Usage
1. JSON-RPC relay with metadium node
2. Ecrecover
3. Sign with encrypted private key on DynamoDB
4. IPFS
5. fromWei, toWei written in Golang

# Documentation
1. Execute godoc -http like below
    ```shell
    godoc -http=:6060
    ```  
2. Open url
    - http://localhost:6060/pkg/bitbucket.org/coinplugin/proxy/
    - If you change port at 1., it should be applied to url
